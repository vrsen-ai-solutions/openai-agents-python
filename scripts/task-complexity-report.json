      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Implement File Handling in Agent Class",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of file handling in the Agent class into subtasks such as: designing helper methods for file uploads, implementing vector store management, updating file/folder naming conventions to include IDs, coding existence checks based on base names, removing settings.json dependency, and writing unit tests for each method.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple concernsâ€”file I/O, naming conventions, integration with vector stores, and refactoring dependencies. Each part requires careful design to ensure maintainability and correctness, especially as file handling can introduce subtle bugs and security issues. The removal of a configuration dependency adds migration complexity."
    },

      "taskId": 12,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Response Validation in Agent Class",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "List subtasks for adapting response validation: analyze the original response_validator, refactor for new response methods, ensure compatibility with both sync and streaming responses, integrate with Thread/History if needed, and write comprehensive validation tests.",
      "reasoning": "While the core logic is already present, adapting it to new response flows and ensuring compatibility with both synchronous and streaming paradigms adds moderate complexity. Integration with context/history mechanisms requires careful coordination."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 14,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Orchestration Logic in Agency Class",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose the orchestration logic implementation into subtasks: design message routing based on agency chart, integrate with Thread/History for context, implement agent-to-agent communication, manage conversation state and transitions, add error handling and recovery, document orchestration flow, and create integration tests.",
      "reasoning": "This is a core, high-complexity task involving message routing, state management, error handling, and multi-agent coordination. It requires a robust design to ensure scalability and reliability, as orchestration is central to the system's operation."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 15,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Communication Tools in Agency Class",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down communication tool implementation into: adapting special tool creation methods, ensuring orchestration logic is triggered, integrating with Thread/History, supporting both sync and streaming, documenting tool usage, and writing unit/integration tests.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires adapting legacy logic, ensuring seamless integration with orchestration, and supporting multiple interaction modes. The tools are foundational for agent communication, so correctness and extensibility are critical."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 16,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Agency Response Methods",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "List subtasks for implementing response methods: design get_response and get_response_stream APIs, implement multi-agent flow initiation, integrate with orchestration and Thread/History, handle streaming output, document usage, and write comprehensive tests.",
      "reasoning": "These methods are the main entry points for multi-agent workflows. They must coordinate with orchestration logic, manage context, and support both synchronous and streaming outputs, making the implementation non-trivial."
    },

      "taskId": 17,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Backward Compatibility Methods",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down backward compatibility implementation into: mapping get_completion to get_response, mapping get_completion_stream to get_response_stream, ensuring interface parity with original methods, and writing migration/compatibility tests.",
      "reasoning": "This task is straightforward but requires attention to interface details and testing to ensure seamless migration for existing users. Excluding deprecated features simplifies the implementation."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 18,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Demo Functionality",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose demo functionality into: re-implementing demo_gradio and run_demo, refactoring MessageOutput for new data formats, ensuring agent source is indicated in output, and writing demo usage documentation.",
      "reasoning": "While important for user experience, this task is less complex as it mainly involves adapting UI and output handling to new data structures. The main challenge is ensuring clarity and usability."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 19,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Tracing Integration",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "List subtasks for tracing integration: ensure SDK tracing covers all agent interactions, support simple initialization for external providers, add trace points in orchestration logic, implement context propagation, and write tracing verification tests.",
      "reasoning": "Integrating tracing requires understanding both the SDK and orchestration internals. Ensuring context propagation and compatibility with external providers adds moderate complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 20,
      "taskTitle": "Create Migration Guide",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down migration guide creation into: drafting architectural overview, writing step-by-step migration instructions, preparing before/after code examples, explaining new features, and compiling troubleshooting/best practices.",
      "reasoning": "A comprehensive migration guide requires technical depth and clear communication. It must cover architectural changes, practical migration steps, and common pitfalls, making it moderately complex."
