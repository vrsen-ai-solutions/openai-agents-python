      "taskTitle": "Implement Comprehensive Test Suite for Core Features",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of a comprehensive test suite into subtasks that address: (1) resolving all TODOs in test files, (2) writing tests for each core feature (send_message tool, file handling, streaming, response validation, error handling), (3) designing edge case and error condition tests for each feature, (4) ensuring coverage for all public methods and classes, (5) reviewing and improving test coverage metrics, and (6) documenting test strategies and outcomes.",
      "reasoning": "This task is highly complex due to the need for thorough coverage of multiple core features, addressing existing TODOs, handling edge cases, and ensuring all public interfaces are tested. It requires coordination, deep understanding of the codebase, and careful planning to avoid gaps in coverage. The breadth and depth of testing, as well as the need for maintainable and reliable tests, contribute to its high complexity."

      "taskTitle": "Update Example Directory",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the example directory update into subtasks: (1) review all current examples for outdated patterns, (2) update examples to use the latest SDK-based implementation, (3) remove or refactor deprecated examples, (4) add new examples for recently added features, and (5) ensure all examples are well-documented and demonstrate best practices.",
      "reasoning": "While this task is moderately complex, it is manageable with a systematic approach. The main challenges are identifying outdated examples, ensuring alignment with the latest SDK, and maintaining high-quality documentation. The need to both update and potentially expand the set of examples adds to the workload but is not as technically demanding as deep code or testing tasks."

    {
      "taskId": 17,
      "taskTitle": "Update Class and Method Documentation",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down documentation updates into subtasks: (1) audit all public classes and methods for missing or outdated docstrings, (2) update docstrings to reflect current implementation and API, (3) document all parameters, return values, and exceptions, (4) mark deprecated features and provide migration guidance, and (5) add documentation for persistence model, callback requirements, and file handling conventions.",
      "reasoning": "Documentation updates require a comprehensive audit and careful attention to detail, especially for a mature or complex codebase. Ensuring accuracy, completeness, and clarity across all public interfaces, as well as documenting new and deprecated features, increases the complexity. The need to provide migration guidance and cover nuanced requirements adds further depth."

      "taskId": 18,
      "taskTitle": "Address Technical Debt and TODOs",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the technical debt and TODO review into subtasks: (1) systematically identify all TODO comments in the codebase, (2) address each TODO by implementing improvements or documenting decisions, (3) review code for clarity, efficiency, and error handling improvements, (4) refactor code for maintainability, (5) enforce consistent coding style and patterns, and (6) document all changes and rationale.",
      "reasoning": "Technical debt tasks are inherently complex due to their open-ended nature and the potential for deep, cross-cutting changes. Addressing TODOs often uncovers further issues, and improving code clarity, efficiency, and maintainability requires a strong understanding of the codebase and best practices. Ensuring consistency and documenting changes adds to the challenge."

      "taskTitle": "Implement or Remove Tracing Strategy",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the tracing strategy task into subtasks: (1) review the current state of tracing and commented-out code, (2) decide on implementing tracing with SDK features or removing it, (3) implement tracing or remove all related code as decided, and (4) document the decision and any changes made.",
      "reasoning": "This task is less complex as it is primarily a decision-making and cleanup activity. The main challenge is understanding the current tracing implementation and ensuring consistency after changes. Implementation or removal of tracing is straightforward compared to tasks involving deep code or test changes."

      "taskTitle": "Final Integration Testing and Release Preparation",
      "complexityScore": 10,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand final integration testing and release preparation into subtasks: (1) plan and execute comprehensive integration tests covering all components, (2) test complex scenarios involving multiple features, (3) verify all PRD requirements are met, (4) update version numbers, changelog, and release notes, (5) ensure all documentation is current, (6) address any final issues found during testing, and (7) coordinate release logistics and communication.",
      "reasoning": "This is the most complex task as it involves validating the entire system, ensuring all features work together, meeting all requirements, and preparing for release. It requires coordination across testing, documentation, and release management, with high stakes for quality and completeness. Any issues found may require rapid fixes and retesting, adding to the challenge."
