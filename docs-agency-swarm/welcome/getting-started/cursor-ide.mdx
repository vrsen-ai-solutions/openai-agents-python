## Why Use Cursor

Cursor simplifies AI agent development by reducing the feedback loop on AI-generated code. This enables faster iteration and provides an optimal balance between manual control and AI assistance.

## What are Cursor Rules

**Cursor Rules** are custom instructions that tell Cursor how to work with your code. Agency has a predefined `.cursorrules` file that contains everything that Cursor needs to know in order to create agents with this framework.

## Getting Started with Cursor

Follow these steps to create your first Agency using Cursor:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Cursor Rules in Settings">
    First, you need to enable Cursor Rules in the Cursor IDE:

    - Open the Cursor IDE.
    - Go to **Settings...** > **Cursor Settings**.

    - Turn on the **Rules for AI** option. This allows you to use a `.cursorrules` file in your project.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add The `.cursorrules` File to Your Project">
    The `.cursorrules` file contains the instructions that guide Cursor's AI. To add it:
    - Download the `.cursorrules` file from the [Agency Swarm repository](https://github.com/VRSEN/agency-swarm/blob/main/.cursorrules).
    - Place the file in the main folder (root directory) of your project.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open Cursor Composer">
    Cursor Composer allows you to create and modify multiple files in parallel.
    - Open Composer by pressing `Cmd+I` (macOS) or `Ctrl+I` (Windows/Linux).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send Your First Prompt to Composer">
    Spend as much time as possible on your first prompt. This will save you a lot of time later. Make sure to include:
      - All agents that you want to create
      - All tools and APIs that the agents must use
      - Communication flows between your agents
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify The Agency Structure">
    Sometimes Cursor forgets certain files or hallucinates the agency structure. Make sure to verify that:
    - All import statements are correct
    - `requirements.txt` file exists
    - `agency.py` file executes properly

    If any of these are missing or not working, instruct composer to create them or fix the code.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Adjust the Tools">
    Run each tool file to make sure they work as expected. You will see the test cases that Cursor created at the bottom in `if __name__ == "__main__"` statements.
    - If any of the tools are not working, send the error message to composer and ask it to fix the code.
    - If you want to adjust the functionality of the tool, either use inline editing `Cmd+K` (macOS) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows/Linux) or send another message to composer.
    - If you are stuck, use Chat `Cmd+L` (macOS) or `Ctrl+L` (Windows/Linux) to ask questions and brainstorm alternative approaches. For example, ask "What other APIs can I use for this tool?"

  </Step>

  <Step title="Adjust the Agents">
    Verify the agent instructions and parameters are correct after adjustments. **Actually think about instructions.**
    - Use Chat or Inline Editing to adjust the `instruction.md` files to your needs.
    - Edit instructions manually and remove all boilerplate text.
    - Make sure each agent has access to all the new tools either by specifying `tools_folder` path or adding them in `tools` parameter.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Your Agency">
    Run `agency.py` file to see if it works.
    - Send a realistic task to your agency and see if it can complete it.
    - If it doesn't work as expected, try to send additional messages with more details and see if it helps.
    - Use these extra messages to guide yourself on how to adjust the instructions, so it can complete it next time.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Repeat">
    Iterate on your agency by repeating the process until you are satisfied with the results.

      <Note>
      **Agent Development is an Iterative Process**

    Currently, agent development requires ongoing monitoring and adjustments to ensure desired performance. As larger and more advanced models become available, this process will become more streamlined.
