Each agent in Agency Swarm also with some built-in tools inherited from [OpenAI Assistants API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/assistants/createAssistant#assistants-createassistant-tools).


## Code Interpreter

Code Interpreter allows agents to execute code within a remote Jupyter Notebook environment.

```python
from agency_swarm.tools import CodeInterpreter

agent = Agent(
    name="DataAnalyst",
    tools=[CodeInterpreter],
    # Other agent parameters
)
```

**When to use:**
- To perform data analysis and precise calculations.
- To handle structured files (CSV, Excel, etc.).
- To run standalone code snippets in a remote environment.

## File Search

File Search allows agents to search through their knowledge base to improve their responses. This tool uses a production-ready vector database provided by OpenAI.

```python
  from agency_swarm.tools import FileSearch

  agent = Agent(
      name="Researcher",
      tools=[FileSearch],
      # Optionally, you can specify your own vector store ID to use:
      tool_resources={
        "file_search": {
          "vector_store_ids": ["vs_abc123"],
        },
      },
      # More details can be found here: https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/vector-stores/object
      # Other agent parameters
  )
  ```

**When to use:**
- To enrich your agent's knowledge about specific topics
- To reduce hallucinations by grounding agent responses in your documents
- To enable users to query their own documents
